# California Housing Price Prediction

Predict housing prices in California using linear regression and data analysis techniques.

## Overview
This project builds a predictive model for California housing prices using demographic, geographic, and property-related features. The model helps identify key factors influencing house values and provides price estimates for new properties.

## Dataset
- Source: [California Housing Prices - Cam Nugent (2017)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)
- Features: Location, rooms, bedrooms, population, households, median income, ocean proximity

## Approach
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Train/Test Split
- Model Training (Linear Regression)
- Model Evaluation & Visualization

## Results
- R² Score: ~0.63
- Mean Squared Error: High, indicating some outliers and limitations of linear regression

## Visualization
- Actual vs Predicted Price Scatter Plot
- Residuals Distribution
- Feature and ocean proximity analysis for high price houses

## Conclusion
Linear regression provides a baseline for housing price prediction, but more advanced models may yield better accuracy. Data insights can help real estate professionals and buyers make informed decisions.
